# Basic Calculator

## Description
A simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is designed for beginners to understand the fundamentals of programming, user input handling, and basic mathematical operations.

## Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- User-friendly interface
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python (or specify your language, e.g., Java, JavaScript, C++)
- Command-line interface (CLI) or GUI (if applicable)


## Usage
1. Run the calculator.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
4. Enter the second number.
5. View the result.
6. Optionally, perform another calculation or exit.

## Example
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50
```

## Error Handling
- If the user enters invalid input, they will be prompted to enter a valid number or operator.
- Division by zero is not allowed and will display an error message.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for exponentiation and modulus operations.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Allow multiple operations in a single expression.
